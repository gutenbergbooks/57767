</div>
<p class='c010'><i>Materials—2 ounces of White, 2 ounces of Magenta or Blue, and 1 skein of Black Andalusian
wool; 1 pair each of Knitting Pins, Nos. 19, 14, and 10.</i></p>
<h3 class='c011'>THE WAISTBAND.</h3>
<p class='c012'>Commence with Magenta wool and pins No. 14, the wool is to be used doubled throughout
the waistband. Cast on 34 stitches.</p>

<p class='c001'>1st row—Knit 2 together, knit the rest plain.</p>

<p class='c001'>2nd row—Slip the 1st stitch, knit the rest plain.</p>

<p class='c001'>Repeat these 2 rows 20 times more, when there will be only 13 stitches; then knit 64 rows
plain, always slipping the 1st stitch; this will make the bodice 25 inches round the waist,
if required more or less, these 64 rows can be added to or reduced.</p>

<p class='c001'>107th row—Increase a stitch thus—knit the 1st stitch; but before taking it off the left pin
put the right pin into the back of the same stitch and knit it off—knit the rest plain.</p>

<p class='c001'>108th row—Slip 1, knit the rest. Repeat the last 2 rows 20 times more, when there
will be 34 stitches; then, commencing at the 1st row, repeat the direction once more.</p>

<p class='c001'>297th row—(For the button-holes) Slip 1, knit 1 (make 1, knit 2 together, knit 4, 5 times),
make 1, knit 2 together. Knit 5 rows plain and cast off. With the black wool doubled,
and crochet-needle No. 1, work a row of single crochet on both sides of the selvedge of
the band, working a stitch to each rib of the knitting.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>THE RIGHT SIDE.</h3>
<p class='c012'>With white wool and No. 10 pins cast on 27 stitches, and, as a guide
to the making up, label the last stitch with the letter <i>a</i>. The
work should be rather loose, so as to preserve the lightness of the
wool.</p>

<p class='c001'>1st row—Slip the 1st (make 1 and knit 2 together to the end), then cast on 6 stitches.</p>

<p class='c001'>2nd row—Knit the 6 stitches cast on, and the rest of the 1st row all plain. Repeat these
2 rows 11 times more, when there will be 99 stitches. Mark the last stitch cast on, <i>b</i>.</p>

25th and 26th rows 14 times.</p>

<p class='c001'>1st row—Make 1, knit 2 together, then knit 2 together again; repeat, and at the end
knit 3. There will now be 69 stitches.</p>

<p class='c001'>2nd row—Slip the 1st stitch, make 1 and knit 2 together to the end. Repeat these 2 rows
5 times more. Work a 2nd colored and white stripe, and a 3rd colored stripe. Join on
the white and use No. 10 pins. Cast on 6 stitches for the back of the neck, work the 2 rows
as the white stripe 19 times, then repeat the same 2 rows 8 times, but leaving 6 stitches at
the end of the 2nd row each repeat. Cast off all the stitches.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first and last rows of the white piece must now be sewed to the selvedge of the waistband
at the side where the points are made; both pieces are to be kept on the wrong side,
and in sewing it take the Magenta stitches, leaving the black row in front. Sew the
shortest side cast off to the top of the point at the back of the band, then sew the 1st stitch
cast off to the 38th rib of the band. Take the end marked <i>a</i>, sew it close to this, and the

<p class='c001'>1st double row—Raise the loops thus:—Keep the loop on the needle, miss the first chain
stitch, * put the needle into the next stitch, and bring the wool through in a loop on
the needle. Repeat from * until there are 28 loops on the needle; then, to “work back,”
take the wool on the needle, and bring it through the last 2 loops on it. Repeat, bringing

the white wool, still leaving the blue, and bring it through the 2 blue loops to finish the
row. A double row is worked with the two colors alternately, throughout the shoe, and
they need not be cut off; the end of every row is to be worked the same.</p>

of the 1st row, bring the wool through; raise 9 loops more the same, and, to † increase a
stitch, put the needle in the wool <i>between</i> the next 2 stitches and raise a loop; then raise
a loop from the next stitch. Repeat from † 5 times more, than raise 12 loops as usual,

front in single crochet, thus—work with the blue wool doubled; commence with a single
stitch at the toe, place the slanting selvedges together, * put the needle into the

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>The White Stripe</span>—Knit 14 rows plain. Repeat the colored stripe and 12 rows of white;
then knit 2 rows of white, casting off very loosely 14 stitches at the beginning of each
row. These ends are for the Lappets, and 62 stitches will be left in the centre; on these 62
stitches repeat the colored stripe and 10 rows of white. Cast off loosely, so that the work
may be stretched lengthways and measure about one yard, including the lappets, which
are now to be fringed as follows:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>The Fringe</span>—Cut the white wool in lengths of 6 inches, take 3 pieces, and put the crochet
needle into a stitch of the selvedge of a white stripe, fold the wools on the point of the
needle, bring them through the stitch in a loop, then bring the ends of wool through the
loop and draw them tight. Repeat along the selvedge, looping in the same colors as
the stripes. Fringe the opposite lappet the same. Then, with a rug-needle and wool
commence at the 14th stitch of the foundation row, run it across the stripes, so as to draw
them all together, and sew it firm; to this will be attached the strings and a rosette.
Draw the other end the same; then, commencing at the centre stitch of the foundation
draw the stripes together for the middle of the head, where the large rosette is placed.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>White Stripe</span>—With white wool, cast on tightly with 1 pin, 20 stitches.</p>

<p class='c001'>1st row—Knit the 1st stitch; but before taking it off the left pin put the right pin into the
back of the same stitch, and knit it off—this will increase a stitch. Repeat to the end, when
there will be 40 stitches. Knit 9 rows plain as before.</p>

<p class='c001'>Repeat the colored stripe and 14 rows of white as for the front, until there are 6 white
stripes and 5 colored; in the last repeat, work only 9 white rows, and for the last row
knit every 2 stitches together, and cast off tightly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fringe one selvedge of this piece in the same manner as the lappets.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>The Rosettes</span>—With the crochet needle and black wool work 5 chain, and make it round.</p>

<p class='c001'>1st round—Work 10 plain crochet stitches in the round loop.</p>

<p class='c001'>2nd round—Join on the gold check, work 4 chain and 1 plain on the lower edge of the
black stitches, leaving the upper edge at the back. Repeat 9 times more.</p>

<p class='c001'>3rd round—Colored wool. 7 chain, 1 plain on the upper edge of the black row left at the
back of the last. Repeat all round.</p>

<p class='c001'>4th round—Black wool. 10 chain and 1 plain in the back of the same black stitch in which
the colored one was worked. Repeat all round and fasten off. Sew this rosette to the
centre row of the 2nd White Stripe of the Back, about 12 stitches from the edge which is
fringed, then draw up the 12 stitches under the rosette, so that it touches the edge and
forms a scallop. Work 3 rosettes more the same, attaching them to the 3 following white
stripes. 5 more rosettes will be required. Sew one to each side where the front is drawn
together at the lappets.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Large Rosette</span>—Commence with the colored wool; work 20 chain, make it round, and
work 10 chain and 1 plain 16 times in the round loop. Join on the black wool, and work
12 chain and 1 plain 16 times, putting the needle in the same foundation chain as before,
but at the back of the colored round; then, with the gold check, commence in a loop of
the black round, work 5 chain and 1 plain in each black loop. Repeat, and fasten off.
Take a small rosette and sew it into the centre of the large one; then attach it to the
centre of the front, where the stitches were drawn together.</p>

<p class='c001'>The back and front are to be joined together by sewing the selvedge of the side not fringed
to the foundation row of the front, thus—keep the back piece on the right side of the work,
and the front on the wrong side, as it is to turn over to form a roll round the face, attach the
corners of the back piece under the rosettes at the top of the lappets. Draw together the
selvedge of the 3 colored stripes in the middle of the back piece, and sew it under the
large rosette; then sew the rest of the selvedge to the 1st row of the front, and turn it
over on the right side; on each side attach a rosette to the 2nd white stripe of the back
near the front.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>The Cord</span> is made by folding the wools 6 times; take a length of about 1-1/2 yards of black,
colored, and gold, plait them together; two lengths will be required. Leave 16 inches for
the strings, and tack the rest to the back, as in the engraving. A tassel is to be made at
each end of the cord.</p>

needle slip 1, then knit a stitch off each pin together, turn the slipped stitch over, knit a
stitch off each pin together again, turn the 1st stitch over, and repeat until these stitches
are cast off.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
